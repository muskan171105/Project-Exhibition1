# Hriday Tarni

Hriday Tarni is an innovative project that leverages machine learning to detect heart rate by analyzing changes in the lighting of a person's face. This solution uses a camera feed to monitor subtle variations in light reflecting off the skin, processing these signals to provide an accurate heart rate estimation.

## Features
- **Real-time Heart Rate Detection:** Uses video feed to detect and analyze subtle lighting changes on the face.
- **Non-invasive Monitoring:** No physical contact required for heart rate measurement.
- **Accurate Estimations:** Powered by advanced ML algorithms for precision.
- **Scalable Backend:** Supports real-time data processing and can be integrated with cloud services for large-scale deployment.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Flask: Web framework to handle API routes and communicate with the frontend.
- Python: For backend logic and integrating the machine learning model.
Machine Learning Libraries:
- OpenCV: For video capture and face detection.
- scikit-learn / TensorFlow: For model training and inference.
- Numpy, Pandas: Data manipulation and signal processing.

### Frontend
- React.js: For building the user interface and real-time data visualization.
- HTML/CSS: Structuring and styling the web app.
- JavaScript: For dynamic behavior and handling user interactions.

### Machine Learning
- Preprocessing: Techniques to isolate the region of interest (face) and extract lighting changes.
- Model: A trained ML model capable of detecting heart rate variations from the captured video feed.
- Deployment
- Docker: For containerizing the application.
- AWS/GCP: Cloud services for hosting and scaling.
- Postman: API testing and debugging.

## Installation
1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hriday-Tarni.git
```
2. Install Backend Dependencies
```
cd Hriday-Tarni/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Backend
```
python app.py
```
4. Install Frontend Dependencies
```
cd ../frontend
npm install
```
5. Run the Frontend
