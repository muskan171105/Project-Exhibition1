                    <h2>What are Heart Problems?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Heart problems, also known as cardiovascular diseases, are a group of disorders 
                        that affect the heart's function. These problems can range from simple issues, 
                        such as a mild arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat), to more serious conditions like 
                        coronary artery disease, heart failure, and heart attacks. They can result from 
                        various factors, including genetic predisposition, unhealthy lifestyle choices 
                        such as poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption, 
                        as well as medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. 
                        Early diagnosis and timely treatment are crucial to managing these conditions and 
                        improving overall heart health.

                    <h2>Types of Heart Problems</h2>
                    <ul id="list">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Coronary Artery Disease (CAD):</strong>Caused by a buildup of plaque 
                            in the arteries, leading to a reduced blood flow to the heart. This can result 
                            in chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, and an increased risk of heart 
                            attacks. CAD is the most common type of heart disease and is typically 
                            associated with risk factors like high cholesterol, smoking, and a sedentary 
                            lifestyle.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Heart Failure:</strong> A condition where the heart is unable to pump 
                            blood efficiently to meet the body's needs. This can be due to a weakened heart 
                            muscle (systolic heart failure) or impaired ability to relax and fill with blood 
                            (diastolic heart failure). Symptoms include fatigue, fluid retention, and 
                            shortness of breath.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Arrhythmia:</strong>Irregular heartbeats, either too fast (tachycardia),
                             too slow (bradycardia), or erratic. This can lead to symptoms such as dizziness,
                              palpitations, and fainting. In severe cases, arrhythmias can lead to stroke or 
                              sudden cardiac arrest.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction):</strong> A blockage in the blood flow 
                            to the heart muscle, causing damage to the heart tissue. This often occurs due to a 
                            blood clot that forms at the site of a ruptured plaque in a coronary artery. Symptoms 
                            typically include chest pain, shortness of breath, and nausea. Quick medical intervention 
                            is critical to minimize damage.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Valve Disease:</strong> When one or more of the heart's valves don’t work properly, 
                            leading to inefficient blood flow. This can involve valve stenosis (narrowing of the valve) 
                            or valve regurgitation (leakage of the valve). Over time, valve disease can lead to heart 
                            enlargement, heart failure, and other complications.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Aortic Disease:</strong>Conditions affecting the aorta, the large blood vessel that 
                            carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. This includes aortic aneurysms (weakening 
                            or bulging of the vessel wall) and aortic dissection (a tear in the wall of the aorta), both of 
                            which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
                        </li>

                    <h2>Prevention and Treatment</h2>
                    <p>
                        Many heart problems can be prevented or managed with lifestyle changes and medical treatment. 
                        Here are some key prevention tips:
                    </p>
                    <ul id="list">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Eat a healthy diet: </strong>Focus on meals low in saturated fats, trans fats, and 
                            sodium, while including plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and 
                            healthy fats like omega-3 fatty acids found in fish and nuts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Exercise regularly: </strong>Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic 
                            activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week to strengthen your heart and improve 
                            circulation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Quit smoking:</strong> Avoid both active smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke, as it significantly 
                            increases the risk of heart disease.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Limit alcohol consumption:</strong> Keep alcohol intake within recommended limits—moderation is key 
                            to protecting heart health.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Manage stress: </strong>Practice relaxation techniques like meditation, 
                            yoga, or mindfulness, and seek therapy or support groups if needed. Chronic 
                            stress can lead to unhealthy behaviors and strain on the heart.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Maintain a healthy weight:</strong> Achieving and sustaining a healthy weight reduces the strain on 
                            your heart and lowers your risk of heart-related complications.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Heart Health Statistics</h2>
                    <p>
                        According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) 
                        are the leading cause of death globally, accounting for nearly 18 million deaths 
                        annually, representing approximately 32% of all global deaths. Of these, more than 
                        75% occur in low- and middle-income countries, where access to preventive measures 
                        and timely treatment may be limited. A significant proportion of these deaths are 
                        due to heart attacks and strokes, often caused by underlying risk factors like 
                        hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, and smoking. Alarmingly, many individuals 
                        remain undiagnosed or untreated until complications arise. However, heart disease 
                        is largely preventable. Early detection through regular health screenings, 
                        lifestyle changes such as improved diet and increased physical activity, and 
                        adherence to prescribed medical interventions can dramatically reduce the burden 
                        of CVDs. Public health initiatives focusing on education and awareness also play a 
                        critical role in tackling this global health challenge. By addressing modifiable 
                        risk factors and ensuring equitable access to healthcare, it is possible to save 
                        millions of lives and improve overall cardiovascular health worldwide.
