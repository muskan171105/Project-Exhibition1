                            The heart is a vital organ that pumps blood throughout the body. It has 
                            four chambers that work together to move blood. The right side pumps blood 
                            to the lungs to get oxygen, while the left side pumps oxygen-rich blood to 
                            the body. This constant circulation ensures that every cell receives <br>
                            the oxygen and nutrients needed for survival. The heart also helps remove carbon 
                            dioxide and other waste products through the blood. Its rhythmic contractions 
                            are regulated by electrical impulses, keeping it beating tirelessly day and 
                            night. <a href="../Functioning_page/Functioning_page.html">Read more</a>

                            Heart problems occur when the heart cannot work properly. Common issues 
                            include blocked blood vessels, irregular heartbeats, or weak heart muscles. 
                            These problems can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, or tiredness. 
                            High blood pressure, smoking, and unhealthy diets can increase the risk of 
                            heart issues. <a href="../Problem_page/Problem_page.html">Read more</a>

                            Taking care of your heart is essential for a healthy life. Maintain a balanced 
                            diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins to support 
                            cardiovascular health. Regular exercise, such as walking, jogging, or yoga, 
                            can strengthen your heart and improve circulation. Avoid smoking and limit 
                            alcohol consumption, as they can damage blood vessels and increase heart 
                            disease risk. Manage stress through relaxation techniques, mindfulness, or 
                            hobbies to keep your blood pressure in check. <a href="../Precaution_page/Precaution_page.html">Read more</a>
