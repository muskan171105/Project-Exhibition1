                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p class="content">
                        The heart is a muscular organ about the size of a fist, located slightly left of 
                        the center of your chest. It pumps blood through the network of arteries and veins
                        called the cardiovascular system, ensuring the continuous flow of life-sustaining
                        oxygen and nutrients to every cell in your body. This hardworking organ beats 
                        approximately 100,000 times a day, pushing around 5 liters of blood through your 
                        body each minute. Its remarkable ability to function tirelessly is due to its 
                        unique structure and the synchronized coordination of electrical and mechanical 
                        processes. The heart's role is not limited to circulation—it also helps remove 
                        carbon dioxide and metabolic waste products, maintaining a balance critical for 
                        survival. As a central part of your body’s physiology, the heart is often called 
                        the "engine" of life, showcasing its indispensable role in keeping us alive and 
                        thriving.

                    <h2>Heart Anatomy</h2>
                    <p class="content">
                        The heart consists of four chambers: two upper chambers called atria and two lower 
                        chambers called ventricles. The atria receive blood coming into the heart, while 
                        the ventricles pump blood out of the heart to the lungs and the rest of the body. 
                        The right atrium and right ventricle handle deoxygenated blood, directing it to 
                        the lungs for oxygenation, while the left atrium and left ventricle manage oxygen-
                        rich blood, sending it throughout the body. The chambers are separated by valves—
                        tiny flaps of tissue that open and close to ensure blood flows in one direction, 
                        preventing any backflow. These valves include the tricuspid valve, pulmonary valve, 
                        mitral valve, and aortic valve. Surrounding the heart, the pericardium—a protective 
                        sac—helps cushion and anchor the heart in place, ensuring it functions optimally 
                        within the chest cavity. The structure of the heart reflects its critical job, with 
                        each chamber and valve uniquely designed to support efficient circulation in a 
                        continuous loop.

                    <h2>How the Heart Works</h2>
                    <p class="content">The heart works as follows:</p>
                    <ol id="list">
                        <li>
                            Deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium through the superior and inferior 
                            vena cava.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The right atrium pumps the blood into the right ventricle, which sends it to 
                            the lungs for oxygenation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Oxygen-rich blood from the lungs returns to the left atrium, via the pulmonary veins.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The left atrium pumps blood into the left ventricle, which distributes it 
                            to the entire body via the aorta.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As the left ventricle contracts, it generates the force necessary to propel 
                            blood through the aorta and into systemic circulation, delivering oxygen and 
                            nutrients to all organs and tissues.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The aortic valve opens, allowing blood to flow from the left ventricle into 
                            the aorta, and then closes to prevent backflow.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The right ventricle contracts, pushing blood into the pulmonary artery, which 
                            carries it to the lungs for oxygenation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The pulmonary valve opens to allow blood into the pulmonary artery and closes 
                            to prevent blood from flowing back into the right ventricle.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As blood circulates through the lungs, it picks up oxygen and releases carbon 
                            dioxide, a waste product of metabolism.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once oxygenated, the blood returns to the left atrium, completing one full 
                            cycle of the heart's function.
                            
                        </li>
                        <h3>
                            The process is continuous, with each heart beat ensuring blood is pumped 
                            efficiently to all parts of the body, supporting essential functions like 
                            respiration, digestion, and cellular activity.
                        </h3>

                    <h2>Heartbeat</h2>
                    <p>
                        The heart's rhythmic contractions are controlled by electrical impulses, which 
                        originate in the sinoatrial (SA) node, often referred to as the heart's natural 
                        pacemaker. These electrical signals travel through the atria, causing them to 
                        contract and push blood into the ventricles. The signal then reaches the 
                        atrioventricular (AV) node, which briefly delays the impulse before passing it to 
                        the bundle of His and the Purkinje fibers, ensuring coordinated contraction of the 
                        ventricles. This process ensures that the heart beats in a regular rhythm, allowing 
                        blood to flow efficiently throughout the body. The contraction of the heart muscle 
                        is called systole, while the relaxation phase is called diastole. During systole, 
                        the ventricles contract, pushing blood out of the heart to the lungs and the body. 
                        During diastole, the heart relaxes and refills with blood, preparing for the next 
                        beat. The electrical impulses are influenced by external factors like physical 
                        activity, stress, and hormonal changes, which can affect the heart rate. In a 
                        healthy heart, this system works seamlessly to keep the heartbeat within a normal 
                        range, ensuring adequate circulation of blood to vital organs and tissues.
